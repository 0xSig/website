# Owlot / Lotte

## About

I'm a Senior Cloud Consultant with a background in Linux Sysops and Software Engineering (front-end and back-end).
I came in touch with AWS about 8 years ago and since then learned a lot about the cloud, serverless architectures, and also GCP.
I'm intrigued about the crypto space and all the possibilities DAOs and web3 could bring.

*Fun fact:* I used to want to be a pastry baker and still love to bake stuff in my free time

### Team contributions

 * Process automation
 * DevOps
 * Website maintenance and improvements

### Main skills

 * ***Programming:*** Python, Go, Perl, C#, Bash, Vue.js/Nuxt.js
 * ***Automation:*** Terraform/Ansible/CloudFormation, AWS Lambda, CICD
 * ***Infrastructure/ Systems:*** GCP, AWS, Linux, Docker

## Please involve me!

I'm interested in anything related to setting up infrastructures, defining software architectures, implementing process automation, but also web3.
My web3 background is minimal, but I'd really like to get some more experience in that field.

I also have a bit of OCD, so if you need something to be organized/ managed/ streamlined, I might just start doing that automatically if you involve me in your project ;-)
